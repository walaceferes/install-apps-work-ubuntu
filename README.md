This shell script has been created to simplify the installation of some applications I currently use in my work. Of course, there are some other apps that I use, but these are already installed in the image created by the team at the company where I currently work:

* Visual Studio Code
* Flameshot
* VLC Media Player
* Sublime Text
* VirtualBox

# **How to Use the Script**

**Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/walaceferes/install-apps-work-ubuntu.git
```
**Navigate to the Script Directory:**

```
cd install-apps-work-ubuntu.git/
```

**Give Execution Permission to the Script:**
```
sudo chmod +x install_apps.sh
```

**Run the Script:**

```
./install_apps.sh
```

The script will update the package index, install essential packages, and then proceed to install the aforementioned applications on your Ubuntu system.
